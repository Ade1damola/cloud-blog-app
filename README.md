# Cloud-Native Blog Application

A production-grade, two-tier blog application deployed on AWS with complete CI/CD automation and security scanning.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](architecture-diagram.png)

### Architecture Overview

- **Frontend Tier**: Flask web application serving HTML/CSS interface
- **Backend Tier**: REST API handling business logic
- **Database**: AWS RDS PostgreSQL (managed database service)
- **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer for high availability
- **Network**: Custom VPC with public and private subnets
- **Deployment**: Fully automated CI/CD pipeline with security scanning

### Network Architecture

## Live Application
URL: [Live URL](http://YOUR-ALB-URL-HERE.elb.amazonaws.com)

## Features
- Create, read, update, and delete blog posts
- Responsive web interface
- Secure database storage
- Automated deployments
- Security scanning (Terraform & Docker images)
- High availability with load balancing

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Python Flask, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Python Flask, REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (AWS RDS)
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, AWS (VPC, EC2, RDS, ALB)
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Security**: tfsec, Trivy

## Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop
- AWS Account
- Docker Hub Account
- GitHub Account

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ade1damola/cloud-blog-app.git
   cd cloud-blog-app
```

2. Start the application
```bash
    docker-compose up --build
```

3. Access the application:
Open browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

4. Stop the application
```bash
    docker-compose down
```

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- **Private Subnets**: Application and database are isolated in private subnets with no direct internet access
- **NAT Gateway**: Enables private resources to access internet for updates without exposing them
- **Public Subnet**: Only the load balancer is internet-facing

### Security Groups (Firewall Rules)
- **ALB Security Group**: Accepts HTTP (port 80) from anywhere, forwards to EC2
- **EC2 Security Group**: Only accepts traffic from ALB on port 8080, SSH from anywhere for deployment
- **RDS Security Group**: Only accepts PostgreSQL (port 5432) connections from EC2 instance

### Application Security
- Environment variables for sensitive data (no hardcoded credentials)
- Database password managed through GitHub Secrets
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline:
  - **tfsec**: Scans Terraform code for misconfigurations
  - **Trivy**: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities

### Data Protection
- RDS encryption at rest
- Terraform state stored encrypted in S3
- Private subnets prevent direct database access

## 📁 Project Structure

├── frontend/              # Frontend Flask application
├── backend/               # Backend REST API
├── terraform/             # Infrastructure as Code
├── .github/workflows/     # CI/CD pipeline
├── docker-compose.yml     # Local development setup
└── README.md             # This file
```

## CI/CD Pipeline
The pipeline runs automatically on every push to main:
- **Test**: Runs syntax checks on Python code
- **Security Scan**:
    - Scans Terraform code with tfsec
    - Scans Docker images with Trivy
- **Build**: Builds and pushes Docker images to Docker Hub
- **Deploy**:
    - Provisions/updates AWS infrastructure with Terraform
    - Deploys containers to EC2 instance

## Testing
```bash
# Run Python syntax checks
python -m py_compile backend/app.py
python -m py_compile frontend/app.py

# Test Docker builds
docker build -t backend:test backend/
docker build -t frontend:test frontend/
```

## Infrastructure Details
- **VPC CIDR**: 10.0.0.0/16
- **Public Subnets**: 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24
- **Private Subnets**: 10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.11.0/24
- **EC2 Instance**: t2.micro (free tier)
- **RDS Instance**: db.t3.micro PostgreSQL 15.4
- **Region**: us-east-1

## Monitoring
- ALB Health Checks every 30 seconds
- Target considered healthy after 2 successful checks
- Target considered unhealthy after 2 failed checks

## Cleanup
To destroy all AWS resources:
```bash
cd terraform
terraform destroy \
```

**Warning**: This will permanently delete all data.

## Reflection

### What inspired this project?
This project was created as part of the AWAKE 7.0 Cloud Engineering Bootcamp capstone to demonstrate mastery of cloud-native application development, infrastructure as code, and DevOps best practices.

### Biggest challenge
Implementing secure networking architecture with proper subnet isolation while maintaining connectivity between tiers. Understanding VPC routing, security groups, and the interaction between public/private subnets required careful planning.

### Key learnings
- Importance of security-first design (private subnets, security groups)
- Value of infrastructure as code for reproducibility
- Benefits of automated security scanning in CI/CD
- How to structure a production-grade cloud application
